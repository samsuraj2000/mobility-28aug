Improving Utility in Public Places: The utilisation of steerable audio arrays has also crept into public places such as airports, railway stations, and shopping malls. The increase in utility has come because such systems present clear announcements over large areas without excessive volume levels. This way, messages are clearly communicated to the people for whom the messages are intended without creating noise pollution.

This is considered a growth driver in the entertainment industry, alongside live events and theaters. These systems find their application in live concerts, conferences, and other events. They deliver audio to certain sections of the audience in an attempt to ensure an increased immersive experience.

# Market Challenges
High Initial Costs: Installation costs are the major barriers to the expansion of the steerable audio arrays market. Advanced systems require such massive investments in hardware and software that smaller installations cannot afford the cost of such installations.

Installation and operational complexity: steerable audio arrays require certain knowledge and expertise to install and operate. The built-in technicalities of this array while setting optimal performance are very potential to make users of such devices quite wary, especially in fields where technical resources could be at a premium or limited.

They also run the risk of competition from conventional audio systems since they are cheaper to buy and install. In fact, manufacturing companies are still struggling to try and convince potential customers of the long-term benefits steerable arrays have over conventional systems.
